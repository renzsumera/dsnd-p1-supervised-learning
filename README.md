# Supervised Learning
Used Python to build an algorithm to best identify potential donors of a fictitious charity organization. Evaluated and optimized several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The dataset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries.
